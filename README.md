# SUEvent
What is SUEvent?
SUEvent is a CS310 project designed to help Sabancı University students connect with others who share similar interests. Whether you’d like to watch a movie, play a sport, or engage in other fun activities, SUEvent makes it easy to find someone to join you.

Why SUEvent?
At Sabancı University, opportunities to socialize outside of student club activities are often limited. Recognizing this challenge, we created SUEvent to make it easier for members of the Sabancı University community to meet new people and build meaningful connections.
