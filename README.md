# SUEvent
## What is SUEvent?
SUEvent is a CS310 project designed to help Sabancı University students connect with others who share similar interests. Whether you’d like to watch a movie, play a sport, or engage in other fun activities, SUEvent makes it easy to find someone to join you.

## Why SUEvent?
At Sabancı University, opportunities to socialize outside of student club activities are often limited and difficult to track. Recognizing this challenge, we will create SUEvent to make it easier for Sabanci University members to find opportunities to socialise and connect, as SUEvent will give users the perfect platform to find, track, announce events and other activities with ease.
